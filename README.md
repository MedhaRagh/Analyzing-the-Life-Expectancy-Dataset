# ANALYZING THE LIFE EXPECTANCY DATASET
## What is this project?
The purpose of this project was to analyze the factors that affect Life Expectancy with the help of a Data Visualization software called [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).

It has been observed that in the past 15 years, there has been a huge development in the health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have considered data from the years 2000-2015.

Furthermore, there have been a lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. But it was found that the effect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past. Hence, this analysis will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors.

## Why Tableau?
Tableau is a visual analytics engine that makes it easier to create interactive visual analytics in the form of dashboards.

Tableau is a very effective tool to create interactive data visualizations very quickly. It is very simple and user-friendly. Tableau can create complex graphs giving a similar feel as the pivot table graphs in Excel. Moreover, it can handle a lot more data and quickly provide calculations on datasets.

You can download Tableau Desktop from [here](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download).
